# Tutorial

- welcome to the word! you are probably on a big mountain, use the arrow keys or WASD to move around, use Q and E to rotate. You can click on anything to inspect it
- lets make a town! open the build menu, and select town center, place it anywhere you like. You will see large bounded areas called regions, these define larger areas of automation like a county, your town's claimed land will be included in one of these.
- Great spot! now your villagers are probably wandering around, chop some trees by right clicking on some trees near your town center and selecting chop
- they will stock up your town center with some wood, in the build menu, you should have unlocked the shack! build a few of these, maybe a farm etc

villagers work automatically, build building or designate trees to chop and the will do it
logging shack makes them auto chop wood

logging shack will make them routinely chop trees

quarry lets them gather stone from a rock (quarry has to face the rock to allow placement)

new villagers will spawn based on your housing capacity

houses stock up with wheat and wood to use for their fires and eating
